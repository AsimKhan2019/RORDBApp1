# ROR Application 1

The purpose of the application is to test that whether we can create a user from one ROR application portal and then 
have the ability to login from another ROR application. I have made a simple ROR application using devise to create a 
new user and then using the same PostgreSql to create an admin and also login from another ROR application.
